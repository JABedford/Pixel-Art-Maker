# Pixel Art Maker ðŸŽ¨ Project Rubric
My Pixel Art Maker project for the Udacity Scholarship. A single page web application created using JavaScript and JQuery.

## Project Specification

#### JavaScript Loops and Functions
- The student implements while and for loops to clear and create the grid dynamically.
- Student successfully implements makeGrid() and call it upon the user submitting the grid size.

#### JavaScript Selectors and Event Listeners
- The student uses selectors to access user input values and select elements in the DOM.
- The student uses event listeners to trigger grid creation, and modify the grid colors.

#### Code Quality
- Code is ready for review, meaning new lines and indentation are used for easy readability.





# To-Do List
- Different color for eraser button once selected so you know that the eraser is in use.
- Take tools out of modal box, and use that solely for the resizing of the canvas.
- Have 5-10 preset colors down the side of the canvas.
- Have the eraser down the side of the canvas.
- Have the redo/undo buttons down the side of the canvas.
- Sort of styling issues.
